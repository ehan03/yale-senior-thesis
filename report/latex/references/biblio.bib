abstract="Mixed Martial Arts is a rapidly growing combat sport that has a highly multi-dimensional nature. Due to a large number of possible strategies available to each fighter, and multitude of skills and techniques involved, the potential for upset in any fight is very high. That is the chance of a highly skilled, veteran athlete being defeated by an athlete with significantly less experience is possible. This problem is further exacerbated by the lack of a well-defined, time series database of fighter profiles prior to every fight. In this paper, we attempt to develop an efficient model based on the machine learning algorithms for the prior prediction of UFC fights. The efficacy of various machine learning models based on Perceptron, Random Forests, Decision Trees classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers is tested on a time series set of a fighter's data before each fight.",

abstract = {AI has been more and more widely applied in sports industry, from match outcome prediction, to tacticle decision making, from helping referee to make more precise decision to help the athelete to prevent the potential injury. This study focuses on how to use machine learning predicting the match outcome and identifying the influential factors impacting the outcome in UFC, one of the most money ball game. The dataset utilized in the study covers every match from March 1994 to March 2021, with over 100 variables of the information about the two fighters in the ring, which are suitable to be processed by machine learning methods. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT), Support Vector Machines(SVM) are adopted to predict the match outcome and identify the top 10 most important features. Performance metrics such as accuracy, Cohen's kappa, sensitivity, and specificity were used for comparison. Random Forest and GBDT achieved improvement with important features only, whereas, SVM declined in both accuracy and reliability. Although findings of the top 10 important features varied across the models, but the date when the fight took place the age difference between two fighters are top2 in all three models.},

Our approach utilises data scraped from freely available websites to estimate fighters’ skills in various key aspects of the sport. With these skill estimates, we simulate the contest as an actual fight using Markov chains, rather than predicting a binary outcome. We compare the model’s accuracy to that of the bookmakers using their historical odds and show that the model can be used as the basis of a successful betting strategy.}

abstract = {We introduce a forecasting system designed to profit from sports-betting market using machine learning. We contribute three main novel ingredients. First, previous attempts to learn models for match-outcome prediction maximized the model’s predictive accuracy as the single criterion. Unlike these approaches, we also reduce the model’s correlation with the bookmaker’s predictions available through the published odds. We show that such an optimized model allows for better profit generation, and the approach is thus a way to ‘exploit’ the bookmaker. The second novelty is in the application of convolutional neural networks for match outcome prediction. The convolution layer enables to leverage a vast number of player-related statistics on its input. Thirdly, we adopt elements of the modern portfolio theory to design a strategy for bet distribution according to the odds and model predictions, trading off profit expectation and variance optimally. These three ingredients combine towards a betting method yielding positive cumulative profits in experiments with NBA data from seasons 2007–2014 systematically, as opposed to alternative methods tested.}

abstract={Machine learning and its numerous variants have meanwhile become established tools in many areas of society. Several attempts have been made to apply machine learning to the prediction of the outcome of professional sports events and to exploit ``inefficiencies'' in the corresponding betting markets. On the example of tennis, this paper extends previous research by conducting one of the most extensive studies of its kind and applying a wide range of machine learning techniques to male and female professional singles matches. The paper shows that the average prediction accuracy cannot be increased to more than about 70{\%}. Irrespective of the used model, most of the relevant information is embedded in the betting markets, and adding other match- and player-specific data does not lead to any significant improvement. Returns from applying predictions to the sports betting market are subject to high volatility and mainly negative over the longer term. This conclusion holds across most tested models, various money management strategies, and for backing the match favorites or outsiders. The use of model ensembles that combine the predictions from multiple approaches proves to be the most promising choice.},
